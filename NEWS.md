# distplyr 0.1.0

The first version of `distplyr` is now available! Its functionality is rather limited at the moment, but is still useful, especially for its capability to handle a discrete component of a distribution. Here are the main features:

- Base distributions include step distributions, Gaussian, Uniform, and generalized Pareto.
- Operations include grafting (right) and mixing
- Distribution properties included are moment-related quantities, and extreme value index.
- Distribution representations are mostly comprehensive, perhaps only missing mean excess function and moment generating function.

Take a look at the "Vision" vignette to get a sense of where this package is headed.
