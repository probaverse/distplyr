\title{Specific Formulas for Quantities}
\format{
An object of class \code{list} of length 6.
}
\usage{
.quantities
}
\description{
Formulas for quantities (such as mean, variance, skewness, EVI, etc.)
of select parametric distributions.
}
\details{
A list, where each distribution gets a (named) entry, with name
given by the suffix of \code{dst_} (such as "norm", "unif", etc.). Each
distribution's entry is itself a named list of expressions, where the
name is the name of the quantity matching the distplyr function name:
\itemize{
\item mean
\item median
\item variance
\item skewness
\item kurtosis_exc
\item range
\item evi
}

Each expression is allowed to
refer to the distribution's parameters by name.
}
\note{
Although R allows us to evaluate distributional representations
of certain parametric distributions through functions with
\code{p}, \code{d}, \code{q}, and \code{r} prefixes (such as \code{pnorm()}, \code{dnorm()}, etc.),
R does not "come with" formulas for quantities such as mean, variance,
EVI, etc. Although these quantities can be computed from a distributional
representation (such as integrating the quantile function to get the mean),
it's often inefficient to rely on such computations. We therefore include
formulas here, and check them using testthat.
