Version: 0.1.5.9000
Authors@R: c(
    person("Vincenzo", "Coia", email = "vincenzo.coia@gmail.com", 
           role = c("aut", "cre", "cph")),

  )
Description: Go beyond standard probability distributions such as the Normal
    or Exponential by combining, shifting, maximizing, and otherwise
    transforming distributions with simple, verb-based functions. Provides
    easy access to a broader space of distributions more representative of 
    real-world systems such as river flows or insurance claims. 
    Part of the probaverse framework of packages to support advanced
    statistical modeling and simulations with an intuitive workflow.
