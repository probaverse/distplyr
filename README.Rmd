distplyr breathes life into probability distributions by providing a grammar for their modification and reshaping. It works seamlessly with distribution objects from the [distionary](https://distionary.probaverses.com) package.

The distplyr package name is inspired by the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) R package: whereas distplyr provides a grammar for manipulating _distributions_, dplyr provides a grammar for manipulating _data_.

## Installation

`distplyr` is not on CRAN yet, so the best way to install it is:

``` r
remotes::install_github("probaverse/distplyr")
```

## Basic Usage


```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(distplyr)
```

Want to model a count variable that starts at 1, not 0? Consider shifting a Poisson distribution.

```{r}
(d1 <- dst_pois(1.5) + 1)
```

Here's its probability mass function:

```{r}
enframe_pmf(d1, at = 0:10) |>
  plot()
```

Or, maybe you have positive continuous data and you'd like its tail to continue as an exponential distribution:

```{r}
x <- c(1.6, 0.9, 0.2, 1.4, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.4, 0.2, 1.5)
mu <- mean(x)
(d2 <- dst_empirical(x) |>
  graft_right(dst_exp(mu), breakpoint = max(x)))
```

Here's the survival function:

```{r}
plot(d2, "survival", from = 0, to = 5, n = 1000)
```

Or maybe you'd like to mix the empirical and Exponential distributions:

```{r}
(d4 <- mix(dst_empirical(x), dst_exp(mu)))
plot(d4, "survival", from = 0, to = 5, n = 1000)
```


## distplyr in Context

There are a few other R packages that handle probability distributions. The key differentiator with distplyr is its grammar, and the flexibility of the package distionary, which distplyr sits on top of. 

Some examples:

- The distributional package also allows for distribution manipulation, but is less flexible, and builds vectorization into the package. distplyr (and distionary) deliberately leaves vectorization up to the user, since distributions can be evaluated to produce a variety of output types.  
    - Development of distributional appears to have happened at the same time as distplyr, and distributional uses a similar family of functions -- `dist_*()` -- to make probability distributions.
- The [distr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/distr/index.html) package allows you to make distributions including empirical ones, and transform them, using S4 classes, but the interface is complex. distplyr aims to provide a human-centric interface by providing a grammar. 

## Acknowledgements

The creation of distplyr would not have been possible without the support of the R Consortium, The Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), The University of British Columbia, and BGC Engineering Inc.
