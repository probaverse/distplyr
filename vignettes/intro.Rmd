This package attempts to solve the following issues. These will become better articulated as the package develops.

- Bundle properties of a distribution (cdf, pdf/pmf, mean, variance, etc.) together with a single object, instead of them being separate objects.
- Provide a more complete list of parametric families of distributions than comes with base R, with a clear specification of parameters and the type of distribution (if there's more than one, as in the negative binomial case). 
- Expand functionality of empirical distributions
- Allow the user to create their own distributions. (??)
- Modify a distribution by splicing or transforming or mixing.
- Provide an infrastructure for computing quantities that are not specified in base R, like means and variances; but also to compute missing quantities like cdf's or quantile functions, depending on what's missing.
