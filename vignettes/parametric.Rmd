There are many parametric distributions built-in to `distplyr`:

```{r}
dst_unif(0, 1)
dst_norm(0, 1)
```

Of course, there is no such thing as an exhaustive list of parametric distributions. There are two ways you can make a new parametric distribution.

One is to convert a distribution for which `rdist`, `pdist`, etc. functions exist. For example, if you load a package that comes with such functions for a distribution named `foo` (so that the functions are `rfoo`, `pfoo`, etc.). 

```{r}
my_dst <- as_parametric_dst("foo", param1 = 3, param2 = 6)
```
