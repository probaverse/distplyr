distplyr provides a vocabulary of verbs for manipulating distributions.

**Unary operations:**

- `+`/`-` or `shift()`: Add a constant to a random variable.
- `*`/`/` or `multiply()`: Multiply a constant to a random variable.
- `invert()`: Invert a distribution, i.e, the distribution of the reciprocal of a random variable.
- `flip()`: Flip a distribution about 0, i.e., the negative of a random variable.
- `slice_left()` and `slice_right()`: Restrict the possible values that a random variable can take.

**Binary operations:**

- `graft_left()` and `graft_right()`: Replace the upper or lower tail of a distribution with another distribution.

**n-ary operations:**

- `mix()`: Make a mixture distribution from two or more distributions. 

Each of these take a distribution as its first argument(s), and return a distribution, making them pipeable.
