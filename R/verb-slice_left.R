#' Conditional Distributions
#'
#' `slice_left()` removes probability to the left of some breakpoint,
#' conditioning the random variable to be bigger than the breakpoint.
#' `slice_right()` does the opposite: removes probability to the right,
#' conditioning to be smaller than the breakpoint.
#'
#' @param distribution Distribution to slice.
#' @param breakpoint Point at which to slice (single numeric).
#' @param include Logical; should the breakpoint be removed as well?
#' This is only realistically relevant if the
#' breakpoint has a non-zero probability of occurrence.
#' @param ... Other arguments to pass to specific methods. Currently unused.
#' @return A conditional distribution.
